# Contribution 
**This a rundown of the rules for contributing 

1. Pull the latest commits for the main branch to keep your local copy in sync with remote 
2. Create a new branch specific to the feature you intend to work on 
3. Provide Preview Composables for your @Composable widgets for easy visualization amongst team members 
4. Comment your code where necessary to avoid ambiguity to other team members 
5. Embrace the Test-Driven Development approach and ensure all test cases pass before any push to remote
6. Ensure your code builds without any errors -> the CI pipeline is configured to automatically carry out these checks
